TODO :

- Remember last roll's settings
	- options
	- threshold
- Side menu
	- history
	- settings
		- (dice count first or dice type first ?)
		- (clear history)
		- (remember last roll's settings) (as checkbox)
			- remember reroll
			- remember reroll 1
			- remember roll_bonus
			- remember dice_bonus
	- about
	- manage preset
- presets
- "add as preset" shortcut in result page
- wish : some kind of help / documentation (maybe in the about) about exactly how each options affect the roll's results
	- help in the about ?
	- Tooltips ? (does framework7 has tooltip ?)
	- question mark in the corner of the title bar for each window ?
	
:::
Things to document :
	- criticals are calculated only from "true" 1s or (dice)s (without the bonus)
	- rolls can never be below 1
	- reroll max will sum the final total (a la shadowrun)
	- reroll 1s will only reroll once (so it can still be 1)



DONE :
- BUG : sometimes the roll doesn't happen and I get left-over data from last roll or "undefined"
	! the "click" event sometimes returned the div and sometimes the icon as "target". Solution, don't use IDs, use class and put them everywhere.
- Rolls with minus should be clamped to 1 (and do not count for critical)
- Update +x to each roll as we scroll the bar in options.



- Options page title should show the throw ("2d6's options")
- Final roll page should have a usefull title ("2d6 + 3 reroll" ?)
- show crit miss as % in results
- flush history once in a while
- fix history save/load of save_data
- Roll more than one dice per "session"
- Implement mersene twister in javascript
