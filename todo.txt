TODO :
- finish translation
	- translate missing strings
- cache kept and dropped results to avoid re-calculating all the time (still shouldn't change results array for history and preset purpose)
- app icon
	- Adaptive Launcher Icons (latest API 26 icons)
	- *Promo graphic
		- 180x120
	- *feature graphic
		- 1024x500
	- *High-res icon
		- 512x512
	- Youtube video ?
	- 8 screenshots
		- 1 x 7 inch
		- 1 x 10 inch
		- JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha)
			- min 320px
			- max 3840px
			- 3 landscape screenshot to show groups of recommended games
			- 16:9 aspect ratio (landscape)
- Can I make Preset more obvious ? (friend tried the game and didn't see them)
- svg button still slightly deform on larger screen ?
- Should going to historical results get a "back to history" button instead of "home" button ?

	
Next Version
- dice first or stats first settings
- manage preset could allow rename ? (button on the right and add toggle for sorting that replace rename button ?)
- find a way to use "back" instead of going /first/ in settings page (because the /first/ might have changed we need to force a reload of the cache and I can't figure out how to do it without trashing the stack)
- if I release for iOs need to add link to "rate this app" for iOS
other options ?
	- Reroll every one
	- Reroll any number (not only 1s and maxs)
- Splash (even tough loading is fast) (re-use dice logo ? or Ombarus Dev logo ?)
	- Not on android ?
- Can I steal "dark-theme" method and do my own theme (green, yellow, blue, etc. ?) Might be a lot of work because of the SVGs.
	
:::
Things to document :
	- criticals are calculated only from "true" 1s or (dice)s (without the bonus)
	- Rolls can never be below 1
	- reroll max will sum the final total (a la shadowrun)
	- reroll 1s will only reroll once (so it can still be 1)
	- skip options will roll basic roll without any bonus or re-roll

:::
name ideas ?
	- Dice DM *
	- Dice Throw
	- RNG God
	- Pen&Paper helper
	- Dice Helper
	- RPG Dice
	- Quick Dice
	

DONE :
- settings : color scheme ? (using framework7 themes should be fairly easy ?)
- clear history when we pass by the "home" page. (to avoid android "back" button sending us in circles)
	- Actually I "locked" the first page and I clear history when going back from dicestats
- android back button after results page will do weird undefined stuff
- rework tooltips to work with translation
	- tooltips text
- placeholder text translation
- autodetect system language (integrated in cordova since 2017)
- bonus/malus slider erase tooltip



- translation ? (https://github.com/framework7io/framework7/issues/1115 or https://muut.com/framework7#!/framework7/getting-started:how-to-localizetranslate)



- option page on tablet is not very pretty (too wide, not enough space between elements ?)
- Setting => sort result.
- Drop x lowest
- Drop x highest
- options page. Reroll "max" should say reroll "6" or reroll "4" etc.
- history should be displayed newest first (not last)
- in history page, if roll match preset, use preset name ?
- dicestats title use preset name if match preset
- shortcut :
	- Reset shortcut when presets change
	- reload results page when resume app through shortcut intent.




- could preset show up as shortcuts ? https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts/




- real about page
- align history icon and numbers better
- validate account info for google merchant paiement method (deposit)
- settings option to hide tooltips ?
- Legacy Launcher Icons (before API 25)
- BUG : preset doesn't stay on first page when first page is dicecount
- "home" button from dicestats shows "undefined" during transition
- back is visible on index.html in ios layout
- link to "rate this app" ?
- android back button should dismiss dialog
- back button (android) should not quit the app but trigger my "back"



- hide preset rolldown when no preset exist
- message when presets are empty ("no preset") in preset management page
- if throw is only one dice... show detail page instead of stats
- "undefined" rolls show up in history on device (previous-page was being reloaded and throwing the dice twice)
- fix d20 visual ?




- send to smash : space shooter proto, nethack in space
- Tooltips ? (does framework7 has tooltip ? (answer : yes))
- save preset should suggest name (same as the results page's title)
- BUG: sometimes end up adding rolls without wanting too (hard repro)
	- roll preset then do a new roll and preset roll will stay in the current_result ?
	
	
	
	
	
- settings page
	- (dice count first or dice type first ?)
		- Still sometimes go back to blank page
	- skip option page
- can only delete one preset at a time (have to be careful of when events are registered when I use dynamic html generated through js)
- load history roll button
- clear history button
- delete single history line button



- history page
- avoid duplicate name in presets
- BUG: sometimes the side panels stop responding on the home page. Not sure of repro-steps yet
- BUG: side-panel stayed visible between pages in side-menu




- "add as preset" shortcut in result page
- manage preset page
- do roll from presets





- BUG: Clicking on more button adds a new result roll
- Side menu
- Remember last roll's settings 
	! decided against threshold, it's not saved anywhere and if you change dice type or options it doesn't make much sense
	! still default value will be half of max instead of 1 (because you'll never want to know the threshold of how many 1s you had !)
	- options



- BUG : sometimes the roll doesn't happen and I get left-over data from last roll or "undefined"
	! the "click" event sometimes returned the div and sometimes the icon as "target". Solution, don't use IDs, use class and put them everywhere.
- Rolls with minus should be clamped to 1 (and do not count for critical)
- Update +x to each roll as we scroll the bar in options.



- Options page title should show the throw ("2d6's options")
- Final roll page should have a usefull title ("2d6 + 3 reroll" ?)
- show crit miss as % in results
- flush history once in a while
- fix history save/load of save_data
- Roll more than one dice per "session"
- Implement mersene twister in javascript
