TODO :
- BUG: sometimes end up adding rolls without wanting too (hard repro)
	- roll preset then do a new roll and preset roll will stay in the current_result ?
- in history page, if roll match preset, use preset name ?
- save preset should suggest name (same as the results page's title)
- exit app button ? (won't work on ios !)
- align history icon and numbers better
- real about page
- Should going to historical results get a "back to history" button instead of "home" button ?
- manage preset could allow rename ? (button on the right and add toggle for sorting that replace rename button ?)
- translation ?
- wish : some kind of help / documentation (maybe in the about) about exactly how each options affect the roll's results
	- help in the about ?
	- Tooltips ? (does framework7 has tooltip ?)
	- question mark in the corner of the title bar for each window ?
	
:::
Things to document :
	- criticals are calculated only from "true" 1s or (dice)s (without the bonus)
	- rolls can never be below 1
	- reroll max will sum the final total (a la shadowrun)
	- reroll 1s will only reroll once (so it can still be 1)
	- skip options will roll basic roll without any bonus or re-roll



DONE :
- settings page
	- (dice count first or dice type first ?)
		- Still sometimes go back to blank page
	- skip option page
- can only delete one preset at a time (have to be careful of when events are registered when I use dynamic html generated through js)
- load history roll button
- clear history button
- delete single history line button



- history page
- avoid duplicate name in presets
- BUG: sometimes the side panels stop responding on the home page. Not sure of repro-steps yet
- BUG: side-panel stayed visible between pages in side-menu




- "add as preset" shortcut in result page
- manage preset page
- do roll from presets





- BUG: Clicking on more button adds a new result roll
- Side menu
- Remember last roll's settings 
	! decided against threshold, it's not saved anywhere and if you change dice type or options it doesn't make much sense
	! still default value will be half of max instead of 1 (because you'll never want to know the threshold of how many 1s you had !)
	- options



- BUG : sometimes the roll doesn't happen and I get left-over data from last roll or "undefined"
	! the "click" event sometimes returned the div and sometimes the icon as "target". Solution, don't use IDs, use class and put them everywhere.
- Rolls with minus should be clamped to 1 (and do not count for critical)
- Update +x to each roll as we scroll the bar in options.



- Options page title should show the throw ("2d6's options")
- Final roll page should have a usefull title ("2d6 + 3 reroll" ?)
- show crit miss as % in results
- flush history once in a while
- fix history save/load of save_data
- Roll more than one dice per "session"
- Implement mersene twister in javascript
